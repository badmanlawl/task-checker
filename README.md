# Task Checker
Task Checker is a standard to-do list made with vanilla JavaScript presented with a primitive UI. 

Each task in this to-do list comes with a title and a description. The user has the ability to add, edit or delete a task. It is also possible to search for a task by entering the title in the search box located in the navigation bar. The navigation bar also includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to filter the completed or active tasks. 

Although this is a to-do list, the data is not saved to a database. I’ll probably implement one once I figure out which framework I’ll be using.
