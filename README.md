# Task Checker
Task Checker is a standard to-do list made with vanilla JavaScript presented with a primitive UI.

## Features
- Add, edit or delete a task
- Each task comes with a title and a description
- Search for a task by entering the title in the search box located in the navigation bar
- Sort the tasks by the status (active or completed)

## Note
Although this is a to-do list, the data is not saved to a database. I’ll probably implement one once I figure out which framework I’ll be using.
